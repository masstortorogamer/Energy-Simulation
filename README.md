You can open the Project by downloading the files, and putting them into a single folder, then opening the Project using Unity, Add Project(or just Add) option.

The scripts can be opened via Visual Studio, or any other program that can open C#.

Update 1.0.1

Added a Snow Storm for the economy, the Player can now only gain Energy Coins(EC for short) during Snow Storms if they contribute their upgrades for the community, EC increases depending on how many upgrades were selected.

The Player can click on the Factory to get a small text of information about what it does, and what can be done to reduce air pollution.

Update 1.0.2

The Ground now gets covered in snow when the Snow Storm happens.
Took me a while to get it done due to trying different techniques.
