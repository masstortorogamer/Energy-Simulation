## Update 1.0.1



Added a Snow Storm for the economy, the Player can now only gain Energy Coins(EC for short) during Snow Storms if they contribute their upgrades for the community, EC increases depending on how many upgrades were selected.

The Player can click on the Factory to get a small text of information about what it does, and what can be done to reduce air pollution.

The Ground now gets covered in snow when the Snow Storm happens.

Took me a while to get it done due to trying different techniques.
