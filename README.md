Update 1.0.1

Added a Snow Storm for the economy, the Player can now only gain Energy Coins(EC for short) during Snow Storms if they contribute their upgrades for the community, EC increases depending on how many upgrades were selected.

The Player can click on the Factory to get a small text of information about what it does, and what can be done to reduce air pollution.

Update 1.0.2

The Ground now gets covered in snow when the Snow Storm happens.

Took me a while to get it done due to trying different techniques.

Update 1.0.3

Added an Electric Utility Building into the game, currently it only provides general information about what it does when clicked on.

Day Cycle has been added, you'll be able to see the shadows of buildings and the ever changing cycle visually.

Trees and Bushes were added, to make the world a bit more lively. (Free Asset)

Added a space between the text at the end of the period for The Factory Information.

Update 1.0.3.1

Made sure the UI scales with the screen size to avoid inconvenient UI size/position.

Update 1.0.3.2

By clicking on the Atom Energy Utilities Building, you can see the total amount of Energy Coins that was distributed to the community.
